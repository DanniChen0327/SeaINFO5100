the encapsulation is used to protect the attributes and methods of a class. When we use private to define the attributes or methods, the attributes or methods are encapsulated. After encapsulated, others can only access the attributes by setter method, and also can not give out range value to the attribute, which helps to protect the value of the attribute.

Abstraction is a kind of class. Abstract class is more comprehensive and can represent a kind of objects, such as people, animal, food, which are the summarizations of certain kind of things. We can define the abstract class as parent and other child class extends it. The abstract methods must be overridden by child classes. The abstract class can not be instantiated.
