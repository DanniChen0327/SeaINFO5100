Explain the difference between final and finally in Java 8.

final:
final is a keyword to define data, methods and classes. 
The data defined with final cannot be changed to other value after they are initialized.
The methods with final scope cannot be overrided by its children methods.
The class defined with final cannot be extended by other classes.
If the class is defined in final, it cannot be defined in abstract.

finally:
finally()is always used in exception handling. When we use try() and catch() to handle exception, we can use finally() to free the resources, no mater whether the exception happend or not.
